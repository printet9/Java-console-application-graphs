# Java-console-application-graphs
Delivery Route Manager is a simple Java-based console application that simulates a delivery route system. It uses graph data structures to represent cities (nodes) and roads (edges) and allows users to manage the network and find the shortest delivery route between two cities.
The application is interactive and designed to help logistics or delivery service planners organize routes efficiently.
How it works:
Add Cities: Users can add new cities to the delivery network.
 Add Roads: Establish roads (connections) between two cities.
 Display Road Network: Show all cities and their connections in the network.
 Find Shortest Route: Calculate the shortest path between two cities using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
Exit: Safely terminate the application.
Why was this application created?
The Delivery Route Manager was created to provide a simple yet effective way to simulate real-world delivery route planning. It helps demonstrate how graph theory can solve practical problems, such as finding the shortest path in a logistics network.
How does it contribute to me or the community?
Educational purposes to practice and understand graph data structures and algorithms like BFS.
And for the community it use serves as a basic tool for small delivery businesses or students learning about network management and optimization. 
This application can be used as a learning resource for students, educators, or small-scale delivery service operators to understand how delivery routes can be optimized using computer algorithms.
